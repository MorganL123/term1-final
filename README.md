# Weathering With SenseHat
Welcome to my Team Edge Term 1 Final Project!  
Curious about the weather? Annoyed that weather terminology easily becomes alphabet soup?  Weathering With SenseHat is a web application that translates real-time weather data from Sensehat's barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature sensors into easy-to-see, easy-to-read illustrations!  Give it a try! Languages used include HTML/CSS, Python, Jinja templates, galore!
